wo Sum : Check if a pair with given sum exists in Array

Problem Statement: Given an array of integers arr[] and an integer target.

1st variant: Create a method which Return YES if there exist two numbers such that their sum is equal to the target. Otherwise, return NO.

2nd variant: Create a method  Return indices of the two numbers such that their sum is equal to the target. Otherwise, we will return {-1, -1}.

Note: You are not allowed to use the same element twice. Example: If the target is equal to 6 and num[1] = 3, then nums[1] + nums[1] = target is not a solution.


input : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
target : 9
Output: [0,7]

intput : 11 4 2 5 3 7 8
target : 8
Output: [3,4]

input: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
target : 16
output: [-1,-1]
