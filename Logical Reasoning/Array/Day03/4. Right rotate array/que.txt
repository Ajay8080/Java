You are given an array of integers and a number of steps. Implement a method to rotate the array to the 
right by the given number of steps.

Input:
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] // 5 1 2 3 4 --> 4 5 1 2 3
                    
steps = 2
Output:
[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
Input :
nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
steps = 5
Output : 
[1,2,3,4,5]

Input: 
nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
steps = 7
Output :
[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
