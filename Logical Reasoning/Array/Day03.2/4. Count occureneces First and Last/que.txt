1 <= N <= 10^4
0 <= ARR[i], X <= 10^9


Sample Input 1 :
length: 7
1 1 2 2 2 2 3
x: 2
Sample Output 1 :
4

Sample Input 2:
length: 5
1 2 2 3 3
x: 4
Sample Output 2:
0

Explanation For Sample Input 1 :
For the first test case, the target element 2 occurs four times in the array at indexes from 2 to 5. 

For the second test case, the target element 4 doesnâ€™t occur in the array.

Sample Input 3 :
length: 4
2 3 4 4
