Problem statement
You are given an array/list, 'arr’ of size ‘N’ update each element of the array by the value obtained by dividing the element by 4 (take only integer part). If the value obtained by dividing element by 4 comes out to be 0, then update the element with value -1.

Note:
Do not return or print the array and make changes in the same array.
Example:
Let the array be [1,32,4], after dividing each number by 4 our array will become [0, 8, 1].
Now replace the 0 by -1 so that [0, 8, 1] -> [-1, 8, 1].
Hence the modified array will be [-1, 8, 1].

Constraints :
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 5*10^3
0 <= arr[i] <= 100


Sample Input 1 :
length: 2 
3 8
Sample Output 1 :
-1 2

Sample Input 2:
length: 3
4 8 12
Sample Output 2:
1 2 3

Explanation For Sample Output 1:
Test case 1:   
The  given array is  [3,8]

After dividing each element by 4, our list becomes [0,2]. 
So as the first element is 0 so replace it with -1.

So, the output is [-1,2].

Sample Input 3 :
4 
0 0 0 0
Sample Output 2 :
-1 -1 -1 -1

Sample Input 4:
length: 1
484
Sample Output 4: 
121
Explanation For Sample Output 3:
Test case 1:   
The  given array is  [0,0,0,0]

After dividing each element by 4, our list becomes [0,0,0,0]. 
So as all the elements are 0 so replace them with -1.

So, the output is [-1,-1,-1,-1].
