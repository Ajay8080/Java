Ticket program

Design a Ticket class with attributes like event name, seat number, and price.



1.Create a class Ticket

Instance variable:-

String eventName,private

int seatNumber,private

double price,private



Create a parameterized constructor for all Instance variable to initialize the variable.



Generate Getters and setters for all Instance variable to get values and set values.



2.Create another class VIPTicket and inherit Ticket class here.

Instance variable:-

String specialAccess,private



Create a parameterized constructor for Instance variable to initialize the variable.

//Use super keyword to initialize Ticket class constructor attributes.



Generate Getters and setters for Instance variable to get values and set values.



3.Create another class StudentTicket and inherit Ticket class here.

Instance variable:-

boolean studentDiscount,private



Create a parameterized constructor for Instance variable to initialize the variable.

//Use super keyword to initialize Ticket class constructor attributes.



Generate Getters and setters for Instance variable to get values and set values.



Create a class MainTicket which contains main method to demonstrate the usage.

//Creating a Ticket object using the parameterized constructor

//Creating a VIPTicket object using the parameterized constructor

//Creating a StudentTicket object using the parameterized constructor



Output:-

Regular Ticket:

Event: Concert

Seat Number: 101

Price: 50.0
