Design a Media Chat process :

 Define an interface  Messanger
inside this having an abstract method

Method Name          :sendMessage
Return Type            :void
Arguments Type     :User[Class Type]
Acess Modifier        :public

Create a base class named as User

Attributes :
name     :String (private)


create an parameterize constructor for initializing the properties.

in this class declare one method :

Method Name         : displayMessage
Return Type           : void
Arguments Type     : String
Acess Modifier        :public

in this method print all the information.


class InstagramUser :

Take another subclass InstagramUser whose super class is User

in this class for initializing super class properties we can take constructor.

take one concrete method

 
Method Name         : sendDirectMessage
Return Type           : void
Arguments Type     : String
Acess Modifier        :public

Take another class InstagramChat which is extend from the Messenger class

and in this class just override the sendMessage method of the interface.

this method is implementing the functionality which only allow the InstagramUser class not allowing to other class give error message.[User is not an Instagram user.]

Take the main class named as InstagramChatTest which is having main method
and inthis just demonstarte the functionality and invoke the method based on requirement.
