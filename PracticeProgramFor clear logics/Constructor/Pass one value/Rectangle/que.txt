Create a class Rectangle. 
Attributes :
names	         datatypes
--------	------------
width            double-private
height           double-private

Implement an instance block that initializes
the instance variables to 0. 

Implement a parameterized constructor that sets the instance variables width and height.

Methods :
both the method is [public and return type is double]
Implement an instance method getArea() that returns the area of the rectangle. 
Implement another instance method getPerimeter()that returns the perimeter of the rectangle. 

Take one Main class ELC class which is having main method,
Create a Rectangle object with width 5 and height 10 and call
the getArea() and getPerimeter() methods on it.


Test Cases -1 :
------------------
Valid Case: width = 5, height = 10
Sample Input: width = 5, height = 10

Expected Output:
Area: 50.0
Perimeter: 30.0
