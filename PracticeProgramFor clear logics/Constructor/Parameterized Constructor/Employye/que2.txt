You've been assigned the task of developing a Java program to manage employee information and salary updates based on performance evaluations.

Employee Class:[BLC Class]

age                          int 
department                String
salary                     double

Implement a constructor that takes parameters to initialize the attributes of the Employee object.

Provide getter and setter methods for each attribute.

Update Salary Method:

Method:

MethodName  	        :updateSalary()
Return Type		:double
Access Modifier 	:public

Implement a method named updateSalary within the Employee class. This method should update the salary based on the employee's data.

notes:
If the performance is "good", add a bonus of ₹10,000 to  the salary.
If the performance is "average", add a bonus of ₹5,000 to the salary.
If the performance is null, no bonus is added.

Create a EmployeeTester class [ELC Class]
In the main method:
Create at least three Employee objects with different data.
Call the updateSalary method for each employee.
Print the updated salaries of all employees.

Test Cases :
