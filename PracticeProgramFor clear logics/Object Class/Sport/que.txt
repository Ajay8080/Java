Design a class hierarchy to represent a generic sports category and a specific type of sport, soccer.

Create 2 classes : Sports & Soccer



Define the Sports class with following specifications :-

Sports:
=======

Methods:
getName(String)                : String(public)
getNumberOfTeamMembers()     :String (public)

getName method returns a String value as "Sports".

getNumberOfTeamMembers method returns a String value as "Each team has 'n' players in Sports".

where n is a placeholder for the number of players in a team for generic sports.



Create a sub classes of Sports called Soccer.

Define the Soccer class with following specifications :-

Soccer:
=====

Methods:

override getName(String) from parent class.

 This method returns a String value as any sports name.

override getNumberOfTeamMembers from parent class.

 This method returns a String value as
["In sports(given via getName()),each team has 11 players".]


Testing Class

A class Testing is provided with a main method. Use this class to create instances of Sports and Soccer, and test the overridden methods.



Test Case -1: Generic Sport

Sample Input : Create an instance of Sports and call getName()                              and getNumberOfTeamMembers().
